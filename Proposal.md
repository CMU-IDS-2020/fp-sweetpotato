**GitHub Repo URL**: https://github.com/CMU-IDS-2020/fp-sweetpotato.git

A short summary (3-4 paragraphs, about one page) of the data science problem you are addressing and what your solution will address. Feel free to include a figure or sketch to illustrate your project.

You can use the "The Heilmeier Catechism" to evaluate your project idea. Please also list which track you choose for your project.

Then one member of your group should submit a PDF of your proposal to Canvas.
