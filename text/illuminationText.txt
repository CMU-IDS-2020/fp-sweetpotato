Illumination data shows solar and communication to Earth exposure over a 12 day surface mission duration. Dark blue regions are those completely dark during the 12 days. Dark red regions show areas of 99% and above illumination and are contoured in white. This white contouring is mirrored over all lunar maps for visual continuity between very different datasets.


Solar exposure refers to terrain illuminated by the sun. Just like the Earth, the moon has an axis tilt about which it rotates. This axis on the moon, however, is far less extreme than Earths at 1.5 degrees. This means that high elevation regions at the lunar poles may receive near constant illumination forever and likewise that lower elevation regions may experience constant darkness. These dark regions are termed Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs). While the moons axis is not as extreme as Earths, some regions at the poles can experience more sun during some months and less during others. When a given lunar pole, north or south, tilts more towards the sun, that is considered the summer for that pole.


Earth exposure refers to the line of sight from lunar terrain to Earth. This depends on the elevation of the Earth relative to the terrain. The more elevated the Earth, the stronger the communication signal from the lunar surface to mission control stations.


This dataset is constructed by modeling sun and Earth elevation on a 40m per pixel resolution digital elevation model.
