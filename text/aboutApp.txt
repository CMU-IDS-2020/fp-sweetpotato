This application has four tabs. This is the Introduction to Site Analysis tab. The Individual Map View allows users to analyze specific datasets individually in a side-by-side and layered view. The Viable Terrain tab facilitates the configuration of viable terrain maps, customizable to riskier and less risky conditions relative to system capabilities. And finally an Operations Planning tab allows a user to manually draw on top of maps -- to configure surface operations, to outline regions of interest, or otherwise. Have fun and enjoy!
