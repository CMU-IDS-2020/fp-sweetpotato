Ice is arguably the most valuable resource in space. It can be used as water for drinking and growing plants, it can be separated into oxygen for breathing, and it can be used as fuel for exploration out into the rest of space. Lunar ice is still somewhat of a mystery. While instruments of the past, which have measured temperatures and volatile profiles from lunar orbit, do provide very helpful information, there remains no ground truth datasets explaining the details of ice presence. 


There are a few things known about lunar ice however. Ice on the moon exists in cold regions less than or equal to 125 degrees Kelvin. A lunar day is 14 Earth days, meaning the equatorial regions receive 7 Earth days of sun over 1 full lunar day. These regions illuminated by the sun for so long do not present habitable conditions for the existence of ice, or at least ice which is highly concentrated. The poles on the other hand, which receive constant illumination at higher elevations, also present low elevation regions which receive next to no light at all in some cases. Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) are a prime example of such conditions. Regions which remain cold and shadowed for years and years provide the most favorable conditions for the existence of ice. Ice existing in the these sorts of conditions would be termed stable ice, meaning it exists reliably in such regions due to the cold and consistent temperatures overtime. 


This ice stability at depth dataset, depicting regions at the lunar south pole which could support stable ice at varying depths, has been manually constructed by modeling surface temperature over time. The dataset is 240m per pixel.
