Site analysis is the process of understanding a planetary environment in order to prepare for a space mission. This analysis is conducted for both human and rover space exploration with the goals of understanding three core concepts --(a)  system capabilities for both rover/humans and lander, (b) science objectives, and (c) surrounding environmental conditions. Understanding a given site allows a mission to develop a more detailed Concept of Operations (CONOPs), specify surface operations, and design the rover or human exploration system around the environmental considerations that come with the environment during operations. This application is designed specifically for rover space exploration.
